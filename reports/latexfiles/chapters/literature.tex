\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{ch:lit_rev} %Label of the chapter lit rev. The key ``ch:lit_rev'' can be used with command \ref{ch:lit_rev} to refer this Chapter.

This section explores the efficacy of machine learning (ML) in the prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD). ML learns from data and experience through training, enabling it to be applied to various tasks based on specific algorithms. This flexibility enables ML algorithms to analyze complex datasets and predict CVD risk.

A review of existing literature is also done to investigate previously published studies in the area. This review  helps to contextualize the current findings. The literature review for this study will look at earlier research on machine learning (ML) in disease prediction, including various algorithms and their effectiveness. This understanding is crucial for developing accurate and effective predictive models for CVD.

\section{Example of in-text citation of references in \LaTeX} 
% Note the use of \cite{} and \citep{}
The references in a report relate your content with the relevant sources, papers, and the works of others. To include references in a report, we \textit{cite} them in the texts. In MS-Word, EndNote, or MS-Word references, or plain text as a list can be used. Similarly, in \LaTeX, you can use the ``thebibliography'' environment, which is similar to the plain text as a list arrangement like the MS word. However, In \LaTeX, the most convenient way is to use the BibTex, which takes the references in a particular format [see references.bib file of this template] and lists them in style [APA, Harvard, etc.] as we want with the help of proper packages.    

These are the examples of how to \textit{cite} external sources, seminal works, and research papers. In \LaTeX, if you use ``\textbf{BibTex}'' you do not have to worry much since the proper use of a bibliographystyle package like ``agsm for the Harvard style'' and little rectification of the content in a BiBText source file [In this template, BibTex are stored in the ``references.bib'' file], we can conveniently generate  a reference style. 

Take a note of the commands \textbackslash cite\{\} and \textbackslash citep\{\}. The command \textbackslash cite\{\} will write like ``Author et al. (2019)'' style for Harvard, APA and Chicago style. The command \textbackslash citep\{\} will write like ``(Author et al., 2019).'' Depending on how you construct a sentence, you need to use them smartly. Check the examples of \textbf{in-text citation} of sources listed here [This template recommends the \textbf{Harvard style} of referencing.]:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{lamport1994latex} has written a comprehensive guide on writing in \LaTeX ~[Example of \textbackslash cite\{\} ].
    \item If \LaTeX~is used efficiently and effectively, it helps in writing a very high-quality project report~\citep{lamport1994latex} ~[Example of \textbackslash citep\{\} ].   
    \item A detailed APA, Harvard, and Chicago referencing style guide are available in~\citep{uor_refernce_style}.
\end{itemize}

Example of a numbered list:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \cite{lamport1994latex} has written a comprehensive guide on writing in \LaTeX.
    \item If \LaTeX is used efficiently and effectively, it helps in writing a very high-quality project report~\citep{lamport1994latex}.

\section{Example of ``risk'' of unintentional plagiarism}
Using other sources, ideas, and material always bring with it a risk of unintentional plagiarism. 

\noindent
\textbf{\color{red}MUST}: do read the university guidelines on the definition of plagiarism as well as the guidelines on how to avoid plagiarism~\citep{uor_plagiarism}.
